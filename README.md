As a player of the game, you will be able to guess up to 6 times a number between 1 and 25. If you guess the number correctly, you will get a confirmation message that you won. If you don't guess the number, you will be prompted to guess again up to 5 additional times. If you don't guess the number by the time your guess count runs out you lose the game. You will see a prompt to start the game whether you win or loose. So play away, and keep playing till you win!

## Why I'm Proud of this Project

â€‹
This was my first-ever project that involved using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Before this, I had only ever dabbled with HTML and CSS. If HTML was my introduction to development, then when I was introduced to JavaScript it was the equivalent to me being thrown into the deep end of a pool. It was a difficult to learn the language at first, but now has become a reliable force that I can rely on. Since becoming proficient with JavaScript, I have enjoyed using vanilla JavaScript in projects like this one or in frameworks such as React or Node.
